# Distribution

The same canonical skills are packaged for several agent ecosystems. A native manifest makes direct installation possible; it does not imply endorsement or acceptance into a platform-operated directory.

| Surface | Package route | Publication model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | `khadinakbarlabs/expo-mobile-app-builder` | Canonical open-source repository and release assets |
| skills.sh | GitHub-backed Agent Skills catalog | Indexed from Skills CLI installations |
| Agent Plugins 1.0 | Root `plugin.json` plus `skills/` | Vendor-neutral portable package; installation and permissions remain client-specific |
| Codex CLI | `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | Direct repository marketplace |
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Direct repository marketplace; official directory is separately reviewed |
| Cursor | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | Direct portable skill install; official marketplace is separately reviewed |
| ChatGPT plugin directory | Skills-only OpenAI ZIP; optional remote MCP is separate | Native skills package draft and hosted service submission are distinct; review and publication are separate platform steps |

Official directory status can change independently of a GitHub release. Verify the live platform surface before describing a listing as approved or published.

## Directory snapshot before 1.3.9 — 2026-10-04

Anthropic fetched v1.3.8 at native commit 11390d0: 501 files, validation and security passed, In review and Live not yet. INVENTORY_INCOMPLETE and the broad credential association remain with a reviewer. No missing or unreadable file or credential source/destination is named. Valid icon and four listing URLs remain informational/no-action findings.

Version 1.3.8 fixed the reproduced Claude discovery mismatch; standard discovery loads all 189 skills and 16 agents. Its exact directory scan did not clear the remaining reviewer holds.

Version 1.3.9 uses a dedicated Claude layout: 312 files, with OpenAI-only per-skill UI metadata excluded. Every native workflow, role, resource, helper and branding asset remains included. Canonical source and the other distributions retain OpenAI metadata. The smaller host-specific inventory is a tested alternative, not a diagnosed or guaranteed remedy for the directory hold; only a scan of the new published commit can establish its effect.

OpenAI v1.3.4 was submitted for review on 2026-10-03 with all 189 skills passed and all six owner declarations accepted. Its same-record upload guard confirmed In review while the dashboard displayed Unavailable. Publication is not confirmed; preserve the pending review and the separate older hosted MCP record.

## Earlier agency candidate — 2026-10-03

Version 1.2.0 is prepared locally from the newer 179-workflow source, preserving its existing hardening and adding five agency/resource workflows. Public GitHub main was verified at 165 workflows during preparation; release v1.1.0 exists and PR #1 remains open. This local candidate has not changed public GitHub, directory availability, installed caches or the hosted Worker.

Bundles use the current canonical source identity `mobile-app-builder`. Before updating a legacy OpenAI record, inspect its actual registered internal name: a record named `expo-mobile-app-builder` requires a matching native update adapter, independently validated, rather than a silent canonical identity rename. No live portal publication status was verified for this candidate.

## Anthropic review candidate — 2026-10-03

Version 1.3.0 adds the Anthropic preparation workflow (189 total), directory metadata, regenerated mobile-development branding, local structural checks and pinned launcher guidance. Its native Claude payload is staged at the versioned distribution directory's `anthropic-source` folder. That tree is intended for an approved branch root; the mixed canonical source now exceeds 512 files and should not be submitted as the directory plugin folder. The native tree omits other host manifests, tests, hosted-service source and source-only release tooling while retaining readable runtime helpers and all workflows.

The owner must verify the candidate before source publication or submission. An authorized later publication must name the exact native branch/folder and read back its public commit and policy contents. Only then should the existing Anthropic submission, if one exists, be revalidated at that exact commit. No directory draft, webhook, submission, approval or live status has been changed or verified here.

## Public source release 1.3.1 — 2026-10-03

The canonical development source follows `main`; the native Claude payload follows `claude-release` at the repository root. Native release contents come from the checked package allowlist, including the README, policies, skills, roles, local user-facing helpers and selected artwork. Source-only build/release validators, other host manifests and hosted-service implementation are excluded from that branch. Both branches preserve repository identity; the native branch is the intended Anthropic source with an empty plugin path.

For direct Claude Code use, clone that branch and load its root with `--plugin-dir`. Portal validation must read the exact published native commit. The directory's listing/review/security result is independent of GitHub publication. Do not duplicate an existing repository/folder submission.

The source-only publisher preview at docs/OWNER-REVIEW.html remains in the GitHub development repository and local review site. It is excluded from all installable packages; Markdown brand documentation and both selected images remain included.
