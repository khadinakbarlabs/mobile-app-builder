# Add Expo Secure Store

Encrypted at-rest storage backed by iOS Keychain. Use for auth tokens, API keys, anything sensitive.

## Install
```bash
npm exec --no -- expo install expo-secure-store
```

## Usage
```ts
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

// Save and delete a small value owned by the consuming app.
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('privateVaultItem', value);
await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('privateVaultItem');

// With biometric protection (Face ID / Touch ID required to unlock)
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('vaultKey', secret, {
  requireAuthentication: true,
  authenticationPrompt: 'Authenticate to access your vault',
});
```

For session restoration, integrate the consuming app's authentication library with SecureStore through its documented storage adapter. The app's auth client owns token retrieval and network requests; this plugin never looks up an installed user's token. Check the current [Expo SecureStore API](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/) for read behavior, biometric prompts and platform limits.

## ABSOLUTE NO
- Never store tokens in AsyncStorage or MMKV (no encryption at rest)
- Never store more than 2KB per item (Keychain limits — use expo-sqlite for larger)
- Never call from main thread in tight loops (it's async, use it that way)

## Add Face ID permission
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSFaceIDUsageDescription": "Access your secure vault"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
