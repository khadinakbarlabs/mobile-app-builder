# Set Up App Store Server Notifications V2

App Store Server Notifications are signed webhook payloads. Decode-only JWT helpers are not verification. Reject any notification that fails certificate-chain, signature, environment, bundle-ID, or app-ID validation before it can update entitlement state.

## Required controls

- Use Apple's current App Store Server Library and its `SignedDataVerifier` rather than `jsonwebtoken.decode`.
- Load Apple root certificates from a trusted, versioned server-side source.
- Configure the expected bundle ID, production app Apple ID, and environment explicitly.
- Verify the outer notification and every nested signed transaction or renewal record you consume.
- Make event processing idempotent by persisting a verified event identifier before applying state changes.
- Keep this endpoint server-side. It must never rely on an app-bundled signing key or a client-provided "verified" flag.

## Verified handler pattern

```ts
import { Environment, SignedDataVerifier } from '@apple/app-store-server-library';

// Explicit public identity supplied by this application's server configuration.
const { bundleId, appAppleId } = getAppStoreNotificationIdentity() ?? {};

if (typeof bundleId !== 'string' || !bundleId.trim() || bundleId !== bundleId.trim() ||
    !Number.isSafeInteger(appAppleId) || appAppleId <= 0) {
  throw new Error('Invalid App Store notification configuration');
}

const verifier = new SignedDataVerifier(
  loadTrustedAppleRootCAs(),
  true,
  Environment.PRODUCTION,
  bundleId,
  appAppleId,
);

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const body = await req.json().catch(() => null);
  if (!body || typeof body.signedPayload !== 'string') {
    return new Response('Bad request', { status: 400 });
  }

  let notification;
  try {
    notification = await verifier.verifyAndDecodeNotification(body.signedPayload);
  } catch {
    return new Response('Invalid notification', { status: 400 });
  }

  const signedTransaction = notification.data?.signedTransactionInfo;
  if (typeof signedTransaction !== 'string') {
    return new Response('Missing transaction', { status: 400 });
  }

  let transaction;
  try {
    transaction = await verifier.verifyAndDecodeTransaction(signedTransaction);
  } catch {
    return new Response('Invalid transaction', { status: 400 });
  }

  await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
    const eventId = notification.notificationUUID;
    if (!eventId) throw new Error('Verified notification is missing an id');

    const alreadyProcessed = await tx.processedEvents.findUnique({ where: { eventId } });
    if (alreadyProcessed) return;

    await tx.processedEvents.create({ data: { eventId } });
    await applyVerifiedSubscriptionTransition(tx, {
      notificationType: notification.notificationType,
      transactionId: transaction.transactionId,
      originalTransactionId: transaction.originalTransactionId,
    });
  });

  return new Response('OK', { status: 200 });
}
```

`getAppStoreNotificationIdentity` is an application-owned server accessor returning the owner's exact App Store Connect bundle ID and positive numeric app Apple ID. These public identifiers are not signing credentials. Supply this configuration explicitly for the consuming app; do not read the plugin installer's environment or accept these values from an incoming webhook. Invalid configuration fails server initialization before any verifier is created.

`loadTrustedAppleRootCAs` and `applyVerifiedSubscriptionTransition` are application-owned server helpers. The former must load current Apple roots; the latter must allow only known event-state transitions. Do not replace either with decode-only parsing or a client-provided status.

## Environment and testing

- Use a separate verifier configuration for Sandbox and Production. Production requires the configured app Apple ID.
- Test invalid signatures, wrong bundle IDs, duplicate events, out-of-order events, refunds, renewals, and retries before enabling customer access changes.
- Return quickly after recording verified work; queue slow side effects such as email or analytics.

## RevenueCat alternative

RevenueCat can forward normalized events, but its webhook must still be authenticated with its current documented verification control before it mutates entitlement state.

## Reference

See the current [Apple App Store Server Library documentation](https://apple.github.io/app-store-server-library-node/) before implementation. Apple documents `SignedDataVerifier.verifyAndDecodeNotification` for notification verification.
