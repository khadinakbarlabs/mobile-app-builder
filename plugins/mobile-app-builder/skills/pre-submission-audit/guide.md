## Output
```
PRE-SUBMISSION AUDIT — [app name] v[version] build [build]

CRITICAL (will reject):
- [ ] FAIL 5.1.2(i): an external AI provider receives user content but no provider-specific consent modal is shown
- [ ] FAIL 3.1.1: Paywall toggle-based design

HIGH:
- [ ] FAIL 4.2: TabView has only one tab + 2 empty states

MEDIUM:
- [ ] WARN 2.1: What's New says "Bug fixes and improvements"

PASS: [list]

VERDICT: BLOCK SUBMISSION until 2 critical and 1 high fixed.
