# Add Secure AI Streaming to React Native + Expo

Never call an AI provider directly from a mobile client. Put the provider key in server-side secret storage and require a verified user identity, bounded input, and a server-side quota before every provider request.

## Required controls

- Use an authenticated backend route. For Supabase Edge Functions, use `withSupabase({ auth: 'user' })` and keep `verify_jwt` enabled for user-facing functions.
- Do not accept a merely present `Authorization` header as proof of identity.
- Keep provider keys in server-side secret storage only. Never use an `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variable for a private provider key.
- Enforce a per-user, server-side rate and spend quota with an atomic datastore operation before calling the provider.
- Bound message count, message size, allowed roles, and request frequency.
- Show a provider-specific disclosure and obtain consent before the first transfer of user content.

## Implementation context

This is inert example source for the consuming app’s deployed backend, not code executed by the plugin. The backend receives an explicit provider adapter configured by the app owner in that app's server-side secret store. Do not read or reuse the installer’s machine credentials, and do not run this example as a plugin hook or local command. The mobile session token in the client example is the consuming app’s signed-in user session, not an installer token.

## Authenticated Supabase Edge Function

The following pattern uses Supabase's authenticated user mode. It intentionally keeps the quota implementation server-side because its schema and atomic operation depend on the application's datastore.

```ts
import { withSupabase } from 'npm:@supabase/server';

const MAX_MESSAGES = 20;
const MAX_CHARS_PER_MESSAGE = 8_000;

function isValidMessages(value: unknown): value is Array<{ role: string; content: string }> {
  return Array.isArray(value)
    && value.length > 0
    && value.length <= MAX_MESSAGES
    && value.every((message) =>
      message
      && typeof message.role === 'string'
      && ['system', 'user', 'assistant'].includes(message.role)
      && typeof message.content === 'string'
      && message.content.length > 0
      && message.content.length <= MAX_CHARS_PER_MESSAGE
    );
}

export default {
  fetch: withSupabase({ auth: 'user' }, async (req, ctx) => {
    const userId = ctx.userClaims?.sub;
    if (!userId) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });

    const body = await req.json().catch(() => null);
    if (!body || !isValidMessages(body.messages)) {
      return new Response('Invalid request', { status: 400 });
    }

    // Implement this as one atomic server-side datastore operation. It must
    // reserve the user's allowance before any provider request is made.
    const allowed = await enforceUserQuotaAtomically(userId);
    if (!allowed) return new Response('Usage limit reached', { status: 429 });

    // Supply this adapter from the consuming app's backend. It uses only that
    // app's explicit provider configuration; it never inspects local CLI auth.
    const upstream = await streamFromAppProvider({ userId, messages: body.messages });

    if (!upstream.ok || !upstream.body) {
      return new Response('Upstream service unavailable', { status: 502 });
    }

    return new Response(upstream.body, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
        'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
        'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
      },
    });
  }),
};
```

Before deploying, verify the current authentication configuration in the provider's official documentation. Do not set `auth: 'none'` or disable JWT verification for a route that spends provider funds or reads user data.

`enforceUserQuotaAtomically` and `streamFromAppProvider` are required consuming-app implementations, not supplied runtime functions. The provider adapter must keep the app owner's secret in backend-only storage, restrict the destination to OpenAI's API, enforce a fixed model and output-token limit, use a bounded request timeout, and translate network failures into a generic service error. Do not deploy until both adapters exist and the security tests below pass. The plugin itself requires no provider credential and declares no provider connector.

## Client streaming

Call the authenticated function through the consuming app's existing session-aware client. That client must reject absent sessions and attach the user's session credential without exposing it to the plugin. Do not embed a provider key, server secret, or service-role key in the app.

```tsx
const res = await sessionAwareFetch('/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ messages }),
  signal: abortRef.current.signal,
});
```

Treat an absent session as a local sign-in error before making this request. The backend remains the enforcement point.
`sessionAwareFetch` is a required consuming-app implementation, not a function bundled with this plugin. Preserve streaming and abort behavior in that client, and verify it attaches only the current app user's session.

## Streaming parser notes

- Use `expo/fetch` or another SDK-54-compatible streaming client after verifying its current compatibility.
- Cap response size and handle malformed chunks without treating them as trusted app data.
- Clear the `AbortController` in `finally`, and never log user prompts, credentials, or provider responses unless the product's privacy policy permits it.

## Consent and privacy

Before first use, disclose the exact provider, what content leaves the device, why it is processed, and where the user can revoke consent. Do not make promises about a provider's data use unless they match the account's current agreement and published terms.

## Security tests

- A missing, malformed, expired, or arbitrary bearer value receives `401` before the provider request.
- An overlong or malformed message array receives `400`.
- An exhausted user receives `429` and cannot trigger a provider request.
- A provider failure returns a generic error and does not reveal a key or upstream body.
