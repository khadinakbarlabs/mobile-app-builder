# Mobile App Agency

The agency organizes the builder's capabilities into eight departments with sixteen accountable roles. It adds ownership and handoffs to the existing skill library; the original 179 skills remain available. Use one role for a narrow task or coordinate a full product journey with `mobile-app-agency`.

The taxonomy is an organization of resources, not a Git checkout layout. Calling it a “worktree of skills and agents” does not create or authorize Git worktrees. Follow the user's repository policy: use the required checkout/branch, preserve dirty changes, give concurrent workers disjoint file ownership, and serialize changes to shared files. If Git isolation is allowed and useful, choose it deliberately.

## Departments and owners

| Department ID | Roles | Owned outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `research` | `market-researcher`, `store-intelligence-analyst`, `creator-researcher`, `ads-intelligence-analyst` | Dated competitor, review, ad, market, and inspiration evidence |
| `strategy` | `product-strategist` | Product brief, primary journey, scope, acceptance, measurement |
| `design` | `ux-designer`, `visual-designer` | Interaction flows, states, accessibility, visual system, implementable specs |
| `engineering` | `mobile-architect`, `expo-engineer` | Compatible architecture, focused implementation, behavior evidence |
| `quality` | `qa-engineer`, `security-reviewer` | Observed interaction QA, regression checks, trust-boundary review |
| `launch` | `store-producer` | Accurate metadata, screenshot sets, localization, disclosure drafts |
| `growth` | `growth-strategist`, `seo-strategist` | Measurable acquisition/retention experiments and readouts |
| `operations` | `agency-director`, `release-manager` | File ownership, dependency coordination, evidence and external-state closure |

Native agents can be discovered by a host that supports the plugin's agent format. OpenAI per-skill UI metadata remains in canonical source and the OpenAI distribution; Native packages omit it and use native skill and agent discovery. UI metadata does not establish native subagent execution. The standalone `mobile-app-agency` skill carries every role card locally so the same workflow works when only that skill is installed.

## How a project moves

1. The director turns the request into an outcome contract with actual owner, source location, owned files, acceptance, dependencies, and authorization.
2. Research produces dated evidence and sample limits. Strategy uses that evidence to define the first useful journey and measurable scope.
3. UX supplies flows and success/failure states. Visual design supplies tokens and assets. Architecture checks SDK/native constraints and defines file-level implementation order.
4. Engineering implements owned modules and records verification. QA observes the intended build on required platforms; security reviews relevant trust boundaries. Defects return to their owner with reproducible steps.
5. Store production prepares accurate local assets and submission inputs. Release management reconciles source, tests, device evidence, upload, review, and availability separately, then completes authorized external actions.
6. Growth uses real measurement to propose the next product experiment and returns findings to strategy.

These are entry/exit gates, not a fixed full-project ceremony. A bug fix can begin with engineering and quality; a listing refresh can begin with store production. Each handoff points to a concrete artifact and reproducible evidence. See [stage gates](../skills/mobile-app-agency/references/stage-gates.md) and [ownership contracts](../skills/mobile-app-agency/references/handoffs.md).

## Parallel and sequential operation

Dispatch agents only when the current user request explicitly asks for delegation or active host policy permits it. Check that dispatch tools actually exist. Give each worker its role card, owned files, acceptance, dependencies, and the instruction that other writers are present and their edits must be preserved. One writer owns a file at a time; manifest, lockfile, schema, and navigation-root edits are serialized.

Without authorized dispatch, perform the same roles sequentially in the current chat and identify that mode truthfully. A named role is not an independent review. If independent review or a physical device is required and unavailable, report the exact missing evidence while finishing authorized local preparation.

## Research and resource handling

Apify research begins with the decision question, current Actor input/output schema, bounded sample, and budget. CLI availability and Actor discovery do not prove a completed research run. Before billable execution, check existing authority for that cost and scope; afterward inspect exact run status and records before claiming findings. Keep credentials in approved environment/configuration channels and out of artifacts.

Use design references as decision aids with source/date and applicability. Distinguish mobile interaction guidance, visual inspiration, and Azure cloud/architecture principles; do not invent a single Azure mobile UX standard. Preserve attribution and asset rights. Store screenshots should show the real intended build; concept art is labeled as such.

## Permission and completion

Session authorization persists across roles and handoffs. A director or release manager should not ask again for an action already authorized in the same scope. Prepare concrete reviewable results before requesting a missing external approval. Research plans do not authorize spend; asset production does not authorize uploads; build readiness does not authorize store submission or availability changes.

A completion receipt gives the result, changed artifacts, checks, source/build/device identity, exact external state, and any remaining owner action. A local pass, a simulator install, an upload, store review, and public availability each need their own evidence.

## Store, creator, ads and SEO intelligence

Four independently usable workflows and specialist roles now cover Apple/Google Play intelligence, TikTok/Instagram/YouTube creators and influencer marketing, TikTok/Meta/Google ads, and app website SEO. The [public Actor catalog](../skills/apify-mobile-research/references/actor-catalog.json) contains 15 real `khadinakbar/` routes whose public metadata and latest-build input schemas were checked through the Apify CLI on 2026-10-03. These checks establish routing and schema availability, not paid-run results or runtime reliability. Re-inspect exact schemas, pricing and source coverage before execution; no paid runs or execution authority ship in the package.

TikTok commercial-library country coverage follows its checked European/UK enum, not a global promise. Cross-platform creator analysis accepts known targets; discovery uses platform-specific Actors. Provider keyword metrics are estimates and can require separate credentials/costs. Web SEO and store ASO remain distinct. See [the starting guide](START-HERE.md) for new-app, existing-app and focused-task entry points.
