# Scaffold an Expo app

Create the smallest cross-platform foundation that meets the stated product goal. Treat all account setup, signing, builds, uploads, and publishing as separate user-authorized steps.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the app name, target users, core outcome, supported platforms, offline/backend needs, and whether the user wants a local scaffold now.
2. Scope a small first release before generating code. Draft or delegate screen flows only when the host supports it.
3. Use the SDK 54 baseline in [the Expo reference](references/01-expo-sdk-54.md): TypeScript, Expo Router where file-based navigation fits, and `npm exec --no -- expo install` for Expo-compatible dependencies.
4. Use `scripts/plan-expo-project.mjs` when a deterministic scaffold checklist is useful. It validates a project name and prints the local commands; it never logs in, creates provider accounts, or handles credentials.
5. Add only the capabilities the app needs. Typical local choices are state management, secure local storage, image handling, haptics, and a test runner. Do not add RevenueCat, analytics, push, a backend, or native modules unless the product requires them.
6. Add an `AGENTS.md` stack contract with `set-up-project-guidance` after the user confirms the project structure.
7. Run local lint, type, and platform smoke checks before proposing EAS configuration. Do not start an EAS build, create signing credentials, upload a binary, or submit to a store without a named target and a fresh confirmation.

## Output

Return the directory shape, local commands, dependency rationale, validation plan, and clearly separated future account/release steps. Never include credential values in generated files or chat output.
