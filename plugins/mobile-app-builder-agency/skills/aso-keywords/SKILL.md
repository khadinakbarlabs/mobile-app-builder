# ASO Keywords

Your entire search surface lives in **160 indexed characters per locale**: 30 (Name) + 30 (Subtitle) + 100 (Keywords field).

## Indexing rules
- **Don't repeat words** between Name/Subtitle/Keyword field — Apple deduplicates
- **Comma-separated, no spaces** in Keywords (`fitness,workout,health` not `fitness, workout, health`) — every space wasted
- **No hashtags, no plurals if singular present** — Apple stems both
- **Promotional Text** not indexed but editable any time (use for launches, sales)
- **Description** not indexed since 2017 (but converts; first 3 lines do 80%)
- **Screenshot caption text** indexed since mid-2025 (use real keywords)

## Free keyword research stack
- **Apple Search Ads keyword recommendations** — actual search volume from ASA dashboard (most underused free tool)
- **App Store autocomplete** — type seed word into App Store search, harvest dropdown. KeywordTool.io and AppTweak free suggester automate
- **RapidNative** — free, no signup, AI-suggested low-competition keywords
- **Reddit** — `site:reddit.com [your category]` reveals user language
- **X/Twitter search** — competitor complaints in user's exact phrases
