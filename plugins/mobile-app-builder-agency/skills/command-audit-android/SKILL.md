# Command workflow: /audit-android

Use this as a host-agnostic workflow. Adapt command names and capabilities to the active coding-agent host.

## Workflow contract

```yaml
description: "Pre-submission audit for RN+Expo Android apps (Data Safety form, AI policy, Privacy Policy, paywall, account deletion, target API)"
argument-hint: "<context>"
```

# /audit-android

Pre-submission audit for RN+Expo Android apps (Data Safety form, AI policy, Privacy Policy, paywall, account deletion, target API)

## Workflow

Run from the project root. Assign the relevant agency role; delegate only when the user asks or active host instructions permit it and dispatch tools are available. Otherwise perform the same role sequentially and identify that mode. Reuse session authorization; role assignment does not authorize paid runs or external publication.

Steps depend on subcommand context (see relevant skills in the plugin).
